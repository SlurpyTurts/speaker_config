#speaker_config

Just a home to store files pertaining to speaker design, particularly crossover and EQ config and measurement data. Will be using Room EQ Wizard (REW) and MiniDSP hardware primarily (NanoDigi), but also some Roon config stuff probably as well as some passive analog network designs...who knows what else!
